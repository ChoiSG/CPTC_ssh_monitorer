# ssh_monitorer

SSH Monitorer is a Proof of Concept network layer keylogger.
It logs ssh/sshd session using strace. 

If it runs in a compromised server/client, it will log every incoming/outgoing ssh session.

SSH Monitorer was created for CPTC tryout material. Because of this, it has no persistence/hiding mechanism.
